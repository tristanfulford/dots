iLO is nice enough, but the fans are almost always maxed out 95%, at 40c temps and I cant fix it. Dell R730 coming soon. \
MacOS magdalena thin client and SSH local DNS makes everything very nice to configure. \
It's overkill as f* for whats basically just a NAS, but I love the rack form factor and the power scalability.
